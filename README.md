# GST Number Validation API

The GST Number Validation API is a Flask-based web service designed to validate GST (Goods and Services Tax) numbers. It utilizes web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to extract information from a remote server and provides validation results in JSON format.

## How It Works

1. When a GST number is provided as a parameter in the API URL, the API sends a request to a remote server to validate the GST number.

2. The API extracts the validation results from the response HTML using BeautifulSoup, focusing on the checksum status of the GST number.

3. The extracted information is then processed to return a JSON response indicating whether the GST number is valid or not, along with additional details.

## Features

- **Validation:** The API validates GST numbers by checking their checksum status, determining whether they are valid or not.

- **JSON Output:** The API returns the validation results in JSON format, making it easy to integrate with various applications and services.

- **CORS Support:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled, allowing the API to be accessed from different domains without security restrictions.

## Usage

1. Send a GET request to the API URL with the GST number you want to validate:

##GET /validgst/<GST_NUMBER>

2. The API will respond with a JSON object containing the validation status and additional details.

## Example

Assuming the API is hosted at `http://your-api-domain.com`, you can validate a GST number with the following request:

GET http://your-api-domain.com/validgst/GST123456789


Response:

```json
{
   "GST Number": "GST123456789",
   "Checksum Status": "Valid",
   "Other Details": "Additional information about the GST number"
}
```


##Running the API
Install the required dependencies using pip install Flask BeautifulSoup4 requests.

Run the API using python your_api_script.py.

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:81/validgst/GST_NUMBER.

Please ensure to handle error cases, add proper error responses, and thoroughly test the API before deployment.

For more information, see the code comments and documentation in the provided API script.
